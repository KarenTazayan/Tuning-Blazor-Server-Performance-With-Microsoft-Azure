## Tuning Blazor Server Performance with Microsoft Azure

This guidline provide detailed steps to orgnize fully automated
DevOps pipeline for the sample solution based on Blazor Server model which works on .NET 7 and Microsoft Orleans 7.1. It mostly uses the following services: Azure Container Apps, Azure SignalR Service, Azure Key Vault, Azure Storage Account, Azure Application Insights, Azure Load Testing, Azure DevOps and many more.

### 1. Create an Azure DevOps project for the solution.

1. Open Azure DevOps portal : https://dev.azure.com/
2. Create new organization/use an existing organization. A sample name: **devops-workshop-10**
3. Create a new public project. A sample name: **ShoppingApp**. For a public project Microsoft provides 
[unlimited restriction for parallel jobs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/licensing/concurrent-jobs) (by default up to 25 parallel jobs) in case you use self-hosted agents.  
4. Import existing repository: https://github.com/KarenTazayan/Scaling-Blazor-Server-With-Microsoft-Azure
5. Create YAML pipeline by using exsisting "Azure-Pipelines.yml" from imporeted sources. A sample name: **Default CI and CD** pipeline. After creation just only save it, don't run it.
   
### 2. Install Docker Desktop on your machine.

Install [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/) on operation system which you are using.  

>Attention! The next steps below (till section 3) are optional.

If you are using Windows 11 or Windows 10 it is more appropriate to use WSL 2 and install Docker Desktop on Ubuntu-20.04.

What are required for this?  
> - Microsoft Azure Subscription, [you can create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/) if you don't have any.
> - [Windows machine with virtualization technology (AMD-V / Intel VT-x)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/user-guide/nested-virtualization)
>   - Windows Server 2016/Windows 10 or greater for Intel processor with VT-x
>   - Windows Server 2022/Windows 11 or greater AMD EPYC/Ryzen processor

Open terminal enable WSL 2 and install Ubuntu-20.04 with the following command. 
```
wsl --install -d Ubuntu-20.04
```
Install [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) on Ubuntu.
```
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl gnupg
$ sudo mkdir -m 0755 -p /etc/apt/keyrings
$ curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
$ echo \
  "deb [arch="$(dpkg --print-architecture)" signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  "$(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME")" stable" | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
```
Start Docker service.
```
sudo service docker start
sudo service docker status
```
You can clone [this solution](https://github.com/KarenTazayan/Tuning-Blazor-Server-Performance-With-Microsoft-Azure) into C:\ drive on your Windows machine ([Git CLI](https://git-scm.com/download/win) is required)
```
mkdir C:\Repos
cd C:\Repos
git clone https://github.com/KarenTazayan/Tuning-Blazor-Server-Performance-With-Microsoft-Azure
```
and interop with it from Ubuntu-20.04 by the following way:
```
$ cd /mnt/c/Repos/Tuning-Blazor-Server-Performance-With-Microsoft-Azure/build/azure-pipelines-agents/debian-10.13/
$ sudo docker build -t azure-pipelines-agents-debian-10.13:22032023 .
```

### 3. Create a self-hosted agents pool for the Azure DevOps organization.

Build an agent docker image by using files from "build\azure-pipelines-agents" based on Debian image
```
docker build -t azure-pipelines-agents-debian-10.13:22032023 .
```
or on Ubuntu image.
```
docker build -t azure-pipelines-agents-debian-10.13:22032023 .
```
Also create Playwright image
```
docker build -t azure-pipelines-agents-playwright-1.31.0:22032023 .
```
Create [Azure DevOps personal access token (PAT token)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/use-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate). For the scope select: Agent Pools (read, manage), Deployment group (read, manage).  
Run Debian or Ubuntu based Azure Pipelines agent by using the following command:
```
docker run -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
    -e AZP_URL=https://dev.azure.com/devops-workshop-10 \
    -e AZP_TOKEN=<PAT token> -e AZP_AGENT_NAME=01_Debian-10.13 \
    -e AZP_POOL=Default -e AZP_WORK=_work --name 01_Debian-10.13 azure-pipelines-agents-debian-10.13:22032023
```
The syntax above uses PowerShell. If you use Bash shell, just replace "`" (backtick) with "\\" (backslash).  
  
>Warning! Doing Docker within a Docker by using Docker socket has serious security implications. The code inside the container can now run as root on your Docker host. Please be very careful.

### 4. Create a service connection for the Azure DevOps project.

Use your existing Microsoft Azure Subscription, [you can create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/) if you don't have any.  
By using Azure CLI create a service principal and configure its access to Azure resources. To retrieve current subscription ID, run:  
```
az account show --query id --output tsv
```
Configure its access to Azure subscription:
```
az ad sp create-for-rbac --name DevOps-Workshop-10 --role Owner --scopes /subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
```
Cretae a new [Azure Resource Manager service connection](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/library/connect-to-azure?view=azure-devops#create-an-azure-resource-manager-service-connection-with-an-existing-service-principal) with an existing service principal (DevOps-Workshop-10), required name: **DefaultAzureServiceConnection**. Choose **Verify connection** to validate the settings you entered
Install [GitTools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=gittools.gittools) for the current Azure DevOps Organization. 
Install [Azure Load Testing](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=AzloadTest.AzloadTesting) for the current Azure DevOps Organization.
Disable [shallow fetch](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/yaml-schema/steps-checkout?view=azure-pipelines#shallow-fetch) for the Azure Pipeline. It's required for GitTools.

### 5. Run the Azure Pipeline.

Run the Azure Pipeline, wait till it completely deploy the solution and enjoy it.
